StreamAMGSDK and MUX SDK Demo App for iOS
=========================================

This is a demo app showcasing how to integrate StreamAMGSDK and MUX SDK into an iOS app. The app is built using Swift and requires iOS 12 or later.

Installation
------------

To run the app, you need to install CocoaPods first. CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

You can install CocoaPods by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

After installing CocoaPods, you can clone the repo and install the dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

bashCopy code

`git clone <repo-url> cd <repo-folder> pod install`

Usage
-----

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can open the project in Xcode by opening the `AMGMuxExample.xcworkspace` file.

To run the app, select a simulator or a device from the dropdown menu in the top left corner of Xcode, and click on the "Run" button (the play icon) in the top left corner of Xcode, or press `âŒ˜R`.

The app will launch in the simulator or on the device, and you can interact with it to see how the StreamAMGSDK and MUX SDK are integrated into the app.
